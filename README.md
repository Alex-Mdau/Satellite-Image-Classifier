# Satellite-Image-Classifier
This project is a Python-based machine learning application using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification (e.g., classifying satellite images into 'Forest', 'Water', 'Urban', 'Agriculture'). Since providing actual large image datasets is impossible, a mock training script and a small sample image will be used to demonstrate the functionality.
